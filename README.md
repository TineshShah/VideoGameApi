# VideoGameApi

A modern RESTful API built with **.NET 8** and **ASP.NET Core** for managing video game data using **Entity Framework**. This project demonstrates my skills in backend API development, clean architecture, and scalable, production-ready solutions.

## Description

**VideoGameApi** is designed to efficiently handle CRUD operations for video game records. The solution follows best practices for maintainability, security, and extensibility, making it suitable for real-world applications or as a backend for web/mobile projects. This repository highlights my expertise in building robust APIs using the latest .NET technologies.

## Features

- 🎮 **CRUD Endpoints:** Create, read, update, and delete video game records.
- 🏗️ **Clean Architecture:** Separation of concerns for maintainable and testable code.
- 🔒 **Security Best Practices:** Follows secure coding standards.
- 📄 **RESTful Design:** Intuitive and consistent API endpoints.
- 🧪 **Unit & Integration Tests:** Ensures reliability and code quality.
- 🚀 **.NET 8 & ASP.NET Core:** Utilizes the latest features and performance improvements.

## Tech Stack

- [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0)
- [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/)
- [Entity Framework Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) (if used)
- [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) or [NUnit](https://nunit.org/) for testing

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VideoGameApi.git
   cd VideoGameApi
   ```

2. **Restore dependencies:**
   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Update configuration:**
   - Set your database connection string in `appsettings.json`.

4. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   dotnet run --project VideoGameApi/VideoGameApi.csproj
   ```

5. **Test the API:**
   - Use Swagger UI (if enabled) or Postman to interact with the endpoints.

## Example Bullet Points

- Demonstrates RESTful API design and implementation in .NET 8
- Clean, maintainable, and scalable project structure
- Ready for integration with any frontend (React, Angular, etc.)
- Easily extendable for new features or entities

## What I Learned

- Building RESTful APIs with ASP.NET Core
- Structuring .NET projects for scalability and maintainability
- Applying best practices for API security and error handling
- Writing unit and integration tests for API endpoints
